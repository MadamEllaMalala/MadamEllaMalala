# Hello, World! 

I'm a computer scientist currently living in South Africa. I'm the founder of [Into Binary](https://intobinary.org), a sandbox that aims at facilitating tech students' transition into the professional world. It offers private one-on-one support as well as small group tutoring sessions. Along with my day job, I play vigilante in my off-hours. You can find me being "Mother", as an activist for [Babylon19](https://babylon19.org), a feminist organization.
